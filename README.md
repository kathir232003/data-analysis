Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on IPL Datasets
Data Loading: Load IPL datasets, including match details, player statistics, and ball-by-ball data for each season.

Initial Overview: Inspect the data structure to understand the features. Use functions like head(), info(), and describe() to examine the data types, number of rows and columns, and summary statistics of numerical variables (e.g., runs, wickets).

Missing Values: Identify missing or null values in the dataset. Decide on appropriate handling strategies such as filling missing values with averages, medians, or removing rows.

Duplicate Data: Check for and remove any duplicate rows to ensure the dataâ€™s integrity.

Team Performance: Perform team-wise analysis, comparing wins, losses, and other performance metrics across different seasons.

Batsman Analysis: Identify the top-performing batsmen in terms of runs scored, strike rate, and consistency across different seasons.

Bowler Analysis: Analyze the top bowlers by wickets taken, economy rates, and overall impact on matches.

Venue Insights: Investigate performance patterns across different venues, including win/loss ratios and scoring behavior.

Toss Impact: Analyze how toss decisions (bat/field) influence the match outcome, studying the winning probabilities when batting or fielding first.

Run Rate Trends: Visualize the run rates over time or across matches, identifying trends in scoring patterns over different overs or innings.
